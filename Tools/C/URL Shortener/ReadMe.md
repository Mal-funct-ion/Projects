# URL Shortener
As the name implies, this tool shortens URLs on a web client. This was developed in C on a Linux Ubuntu Virtual Box Emulator. In order to run this tool you may have to use it on one of those. Some example urls are
already prepared and linked below and with what website they should lead to:

http://localhost:8888/s/AAAAAA  -  https://www.youtube.com
